            <h3>Arabian sea facing impact of climate change</h3>
            This change causes low pressure in the Arabian Sea which in turn brings heavy rainfall. This phenomenon, which was observed in the Bay of Bengal, also appeared in the Arabian Sea three years ago. Changes in temperature can cause cumulus clouds (cumulonimbus) to form.
            KOCHI: The state is facing heavy rains during the hot summer months due to erratic temperatures in the Arabian Sea.

            <h3>Climate change impact on Agriculture</h3>
            Climate change also affects an ecosystem directly or indirectly. Change in climate will affect the groundwater recharge, water cycle, soil moisture, livestock,
            and aquatic species. Change in climate increase the incidence of pests and diseases, which causes a huge loss in crop production.

            <h3>Impact of climate change on Human Health</h3>
            Climate changes will, and already are, affecting every aspect of the hydrologic cycle. Actions are needed to improve our understanding of water-related risks from climate change and to explore and implement strategies to reduce these risks.

            <h3>Impact of climate change on Food Supply</h3>
            Farmers worldwide are experiencing this firsthand. Climate change causes rising temperatures, heavy rainfall, severe storms, and extended periods of drought.

            Many crops fail due to these extreme weather conditions. This has consequences not only for the farmers themselves, but also for the food they produce, and thus for global food security.
